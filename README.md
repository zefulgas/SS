# Lab guides:

Most of the material available for these labs is part of the [SEED Labs Project](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/). Have a look at their project as you have many more labs proposed beyond the ones we'll follow here.

For the buffer overflow materials we adapted some ideas from the [Exploit Exercises Project](https://exploit-exercises.com/) namely the [Protostar Project](https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/) and from the book ___Hacking, The Art of Exploitation___ by Jon Erickson.




All labs should be executed in the virtual machine (VM) provided by the SEED Labs project: [SEEDUbuntu12.04](http://www.cis.syr.edu/~wedu/seed/lab_env.html).

* Lab 1: [Race-Condition Vulnerability Lab](race_conditions_lab/). 

* Lab 2: [Buffer-Overflow Vulnerability Lab](buffer_overflow_lab).
